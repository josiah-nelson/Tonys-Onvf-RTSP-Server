# Tonys Onvif-RTSP Proxy Server

Bridge generic RTSP cameras into NVRs like UniFi Protect. This tool acts as a proxy, giving each of your cameras a unique identity (IP/MAC) so they work correctly with Protect's requirements.

## Introducing GridFusion - Multi-Camera Matrix Composer

**GridFusion** lets you combine multiple camera feeds into a single, customizable RTSP stream. Perfect for creating security monitoring walls, multi-angle views, or consolidated feeds for your NVR.

### Key Features:
- **Visual Drag-and-Drop Editor**: Position cameras anywhere on the canvas with pixel-perfect control
- **Flexible Layouts**: Create any grid configuration - 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or completely custom arrangements
- **Custom Resolutions**: Output at standard resolutions (1080p, 4K) or define your own dimensions
- **Live Preview**: See exactly how your matrix will look before saving. Visual camera placement using live snapshots from your feeds
- **RTSP Output**: The composed matrix is available as a standard RTSP stream that any NVR can consume


## ONVIF Event Forwarding & Local AI Object Detection (YOLO)

Turn standard RTSP feeds into intelligent, AI-capable cameras inside your NVR:
- **ONVIF Event Forwarding:** Automatically relays real-time camera motion events to UniFi Protect as native motion alarms.
- **Local YOLOv8/11 Integration:** Run local AI inference to detect **People, Vehicles, and Animals**, and create native Smart Detection events in Protect.
- **Ultra-Efficient Two-Stage Pipeline:** Keeps system CPU usage low. A lightweight OpenCV pixel-difference detector monitors the video stream and only fires the YOLO model when actual motion is detected.
- **Easy Installation:** The automated installer can set up the required AI packages (PyTorch, Ultralytics, and OpenCV-headless) with one click, or they can be installed later via the Web UI.


## Quick Install (Recommended)

**One-line automated installer** - automatically installs and configures everything needed to run the server:
- **Git** - for cloning the repository
- **Python 3** - runtime environment
- **Python packages** - Flask, Flask-CORS, Requests, PyYAML, psutil, onvif-zeep
- **MediaMTX v1.18.1** - RTSP server for stream management
- **FFmpeg** - video processing and transcoding
- **System configuration** - file descriptor limits, permissions, and PATH setup
- **Systemd/Launchd service** - optional auto-start on boot (Linux/macOS)

**Note:** The one-line installer automatically installs all required dependencies and configures your system. If you prefer more control over the installation process, use the manual setup instructions below.

### Linux/macOS:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigTonyTones/Tonys-Onvf-RTSP-Server/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigTonyTones/Tonys-Onvf-RTSP-Server/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

After installation, access the web interface at **http://localhost:5552**

## Manual Installation

### Linux
This server is optimized for Ubuntu 25.04 but is compatible with most modern Linux builds. The **Virtual NIC** feature requires a Linux environment. This has been confirmed to work perfectly on the Raspberry Pi 5 running the latest Debian 13 (Trixie) build for those looking to run the server on Raspberry Pi hardware.

1. **Clone and enter the folder:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BigTonyTones/Tonys-Onvf-RTSP-Server.git
   cd Tonys-Onvf-RTSP-Server
   ```

2. **Run the startup script:**
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x start_ubuntu_25.sh
   sudo ./start_ubuntu_25.sh
   ```
   *The script sets up a Python venv, installs dependencies (ffmpeg, etc.), and optimizes system limits.*

3. **Open the Web UI:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5552` to start adding cameras.

---

### Windows
1. Install Python 3.7+.
2. Run `start_onvif_server.bat`.
   *Note: Virtual NICs (unique IP/MAC per camera) are not supported on Windows. All cameras will share the host IP.*

---

## Features & Tips
- **Unique Identities**: Use the **Virtual NIC** toggle on Linux to give each camera its own IP and MAC address.
- **UniFi Protect**: Use the ONVIF IP and credentials shown in the dashboard to manually adopt cameras in the Protect app.
- **Performance**: High-concurrency is handled via MediaMTX. No need for manual configuration.
- **Transcoding**: Only enable this if your camera's native codec isn't compatible. It is CPU intensive.
- **VMs**: If running in a VM (Proxmox, ESXi), you **must** enable **Promiscuous Mode** on the network interface for Virtual NICs to work.
- **Auto-Boot**: You can enable the systemd service in the Web UI settings to start the server on boot.
- **H.264 vs H.265**: High awareness is required regarding video codecs! See below.

## 💡 Important: Video Codecs (H.264 vs H.265)
For the best experience and lowest latency:
- **Use H.264**: It is highly recommended to set your physical cameras to **H.264** in their own settings. H.264 is the universal standard for web browsers and provides the smoothest playback on the dashboard.
- **H.265 (HEVC) Issues**: While H.265 saves bandwidth, most web browsers **cannot play it natively** in a web player. If your camera is set to H.265, you may see a black screen or loading spinner on the dashboard.
- **The Fix**: Either change your camera's internal settings to H.264 (preferred) or enable **Transcoding** in the camera settings of this server. Note that transcoding is extremely CPU intensive, especially on Raspberry Pi hardware.
